                We do use cookies to store information, such as your personal

                We also may use DART cookies for ad serving through Google’s

                browsing the web and visit a site using DoubleClick advertising
                (including some Google AdSense advertisements). This cookie is
                used to serve ads specific to you and your interests (”interest

              <p>
                The ads served will be targeted based on your previous browsing
                history (For example, if you have been viewing sites about
                visiting Las Vegas, you may see Las Vegas hotel advertisements
                when viewing a non-related site, such as on a site about
                hockey). DART uses “non personally identifiable information”. It
                does NOT track personal information about you, such as your
                name, email address, physical address, telephone number, social

                However, this can affect how you are able to interact with our

                personally identifiable information from California consumers to

              <p>
                When it comes to the collection of personal information from
                children under 13, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act
                (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission,
                the nation’s consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA
                Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online
                services must do to protect children’s privacy and safety
                online.

              <p>
                The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of
                privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include
                have played a significant role in the development of data
                protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair
                Information Practice Principles and how they should be
                implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws
                that protect personal information.

              <h5 className="fw-bold mt-3">
                In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will
                take the following responsive action, should a data breach
                occur:
              </h5>
              <p>We will notify the users via email</p>

                <li>Within 1 business day</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle, which
                requires that individuals have a right to pursue legally
                enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who
                fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that
                individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also
                that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies
                to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data
                processors.

                them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.
